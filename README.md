# Instant_Melee
Launch Dolphin with only your GameCube controller!

For those who are constantly striving to be optimal, now start your Dolphin with just the press of a button. A press of the button on your GameCube Controller! Now you can get into that sweet Slippi Online action a few frames faster. Simply grab your controller and press the START button and Dolphin should launch immediately.

## How to use

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/RucksP/Instant_Melee/releases/download/v0.9/Instant.Melee.7z) 
2. Unzip Instant Melee.7z
3. Put the path to your Dolphin.exe in configs.txt (ex: C:/FM-Slippi/Dolphin.exe)
   -Remember to use forwards slashes (/), not backslashes, and use the path to the exe, not just the folder its in!
4. Launch instant_melee.exe
5. (Optional) Set instant_melee to launch on startup (otherwise its still the same number of inputs as before)\
    a) Press the windows key and R (Win + R)\
    b) Type "shell:startup" into the window that just popped up (without the quotes)\
    c) Place the given instant_melee shortcut (the one with the icon) into the folder that just opened

## Things that might cause this program to not work

Being on Linux or Mac\
Opening Dolphin by just clicking on it when the instant_melee is open (it will still work, but a 2nd dolphin window will open and instant_melee may exit)\
Not having the adapter plugged in when the instant_melee was started\
Having an incorrect path in config.txt\
  -actually edit config.txt to contain your path \
  -remember to use the path to the exe, not just the folder its in\
  -use forward slashes\
  
Otherwise check logs.txt and send me a message
